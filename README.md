# Deprecation

This project has been superseded by the [coreBOS-RoadRunner](https://github.com/coreBOS/RoadRunnerWebService) integration which is slimmer and much more powerful. This project is still valid and can be used but it is not being maintained. I would recommend you use the Road Runner integration for coreBOS web service servers/containers.
